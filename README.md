## A Solar System Simulation

Small hobby project to refamiliarize with C and SDL2. \
It accurately simulates newtons gravity equation with \
real astronomical numbers and makes it look a little nice.

### Build and Run

The path for the save file is hardcoded as ./saves/solar_system.save \
which means that you must have that file structure wherever you invoke \
the program. However it will work if you follow the steps.

#### Requirements
- gcc
- make
- SDL2 library

#### Steps
```
git clone git@github.com:ikalco/solar_system_sim.git
cd solar_system_sim
make
./build/solar_system_sim
```
